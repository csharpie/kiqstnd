"""
An assortment of functions that convert  models from one
type to another. Mostly used to prepare data for conversion
to JSON in web services.

(Note: django.core.serializer isn't used as much in the code
because it returns more data than is necessary and isn't as clean
as having it formatted first via these functions)
