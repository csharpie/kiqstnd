<p>
    Kiqstnd is a prototype bike parking locator for use in
    City of Philadelphia! The entire version of this app was developed in a little over 12 hours -- which means
    that it's very rough and not ready for primetime.
    It was made to demostrate
    the possiblity of making a bike parking locator that uses real data provided by the City. Not only
    does it allow a user to search for bike parking locations, it also shows them thefts that have happened
    nearby a specific location. The other feature is to give users the ability to add
    bike parking locations themselves (think crowd sourcing).
</p>

<p>Search Instructions (and viewing theft data):</p>
<ol>
    <li>Start on the main [search] page</li>
    <li>Enter a Philadelphia-based address into the search box</li>
    <li>Click the Search button</li>
    <li>View the bike parking locations on the map</li>
    <li>Click on a map pin</li>
    <li>In the bubble that appears, click View Details</li>
    <li>The page that comes up shows theft locations on the map, as well as more details about the parking space</li>
</ol>

<p>Add Parking Instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Start on the main [search] page</li>
    <li>Click on the map</li>
    <li>Fill out the form (not all of the fields will currently be saved)</li>
    <li>Click Ok</li>
    <li>Note: A pin will be placed, but as of right now, you'll have to refresh the page and search for the location again to access the View Details link on its bubble</li>
</ol>

<p>Refresh the Bike Parking Data from the City</p>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare yourself for the database to be wiped clean (don't worry, it'll be reloaded in the next step)</li>
    <li><a href="/services/load/">Click here</a></li>
</ol>

    The app is the result of collaboration between <a href="https://github.com/bkenny266">Brian Kenny</a>, <a href="https://github.com/csharpie">Brad Steinberg</a>,
    and <a href="https://github.com/plusjeff">Jeff Maher</a> (with guidance from <a href="https://github.com/davewalk">Dave Walk</a>) at the <a href="http://appsforphilly.org">#apps4philly</a> Transit Hackathon
    in conjunction with <a href="http://codeforphilly.org">Code for Philly</a> (a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org">Code for America Brigade</a>).
    Future development is planned and we're happy to work with others, so let us know if you want to join in. Or don't, and just
    fork the project on <a href="https://github.com/plusjeff/kiqstnd">GitHub</a> (warning: the code is very ugly right now).

    This app would not be possible without the awesome work of the City
    of Philadelphia that provided open bike data sets. The original data sets we use can be found here:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/187/philadelphia-bike-racks/">Racks</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-open-geodata/tree/master/bicycle_thefts">Thefts</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Lastly, the app makes use of the PHL Bike Theft REST API, a project created by the same group during
    the same weekend. <a href="http://biketheft.jeffsbox.net">It can be found here</a>.
